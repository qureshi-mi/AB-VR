# AB-VR
The code implements the experiments performed in the paper:"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9827792". We include the experiments for classification using logistic regression and neural networks.

## Dependencies and Setup
All code runs on Python 3.6.7.

## Running Experiments
There are three main scripts:
1) LogisticRegression/ExponentialNetwork.py
2) LogisticRegression/GeometricNetwork.py
3) NeuralNetwork/NeuralNetwork.py

## Generalization
This work can be used to characterize any dataset. The user only need to load custom dataset as commented in the code.

## Note
If you use this code for your research, please cite the paper.
